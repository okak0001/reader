                    <p>Many works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. </p>

                    <p>Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original biological ones. Therefore, if we don’t think that we are currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears. That is the basic idea.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>On the most fundamental level, what is the difference between an inanimate machine and a living one? Do people, cats, plants and other creatures belong in one category and K’Nex, computers, stars and rocks in another? My conclusion: No. In fact, I decided, life does not actually exist.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>No one has ever managed to compile a set of physical properties that unites all living things and excludes everything we label inanimate. There are always exceptions. Most people do not consider crystals to be alive, for example, yet they are highly organized and they grow. Fire, too, consumes energy and gets bigger. In contrast, bacteria, tardigrades and even some crustaceans can enter long periods of dormancy during which they are not growing, metabolizing or changing at all, yet are not technically dead. How do we categorize a single leaf that has fallen from a tree? Most people would agree that, when attached to a tree, a leaf is alive: its many cells work tirelessly to turn sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into food, among other duties. When a leaf detaches from a tree, its cells do not instantly cease their activities. Does it die on the way to the ground; or when it hits the ground; or when all its individual cells finally expire? If you pluck a leaf from a plant and keep its cells nourished and happy inside a lab, is that life?
                    </p>

                    <p>Defining life as a self-sustaining system capable of Darwinian evolution also forces us to admit that certain computer programs are alive. Genetic algorithms, for instance, imitate natural selection to arrive at the optimal solution to a problem: they are bit arrays that code traits, evolve, compete with one another to reproduce and even exchange information. Similarly, software platforms like Avida create "digital organisms" that "are made up of digital bits that can mutate in much the same way DNA mutates." In other words they, too, evolve. "Avida is not a simulation of evolution; it is an instance of it," Robert Pennock of Michigan State University told Carl Zimmer in Discover. “All the core parts of the Darwinian process are there. These things replicate, they mutate, they are competing with one another. The very process of natural selection is happening there. If that’s central to the definition of life, then these things count.”</p>

                    <p>Why is defining life so frustratingly difficult? Why have scientists and philosophers failed for centuries to find a specific physical property or set of properties that clearly separates the living from the inanimate? Because such a property does not exist. Life is a concept that we invented. On the most fundamental level, all matter that exists is an arrangement of atoms and their constituent particles. These arrangements fall onto an immense spectrum of complexity, from a single hydrogen atom to something as intricate as a brain. In trying to define life, we have drawn a line at an arbitrary level of complexity and declared that everything above that border is alive and everything below it is not. In truth, this division does not exist outside the mind. There is no threshold at which a collection of atoms suddenly becomes alive, no categorical distinction between the living and inanimate, no Frankensteinian spark. We have failed to define life because there was never anything to define in the first place.
                    </p>

                    <p>Recognizing life as a concept in no way robs what we call life of its splendor. It's not that there's no material difference between living things and the inanimate; rather, we will never find some clean dividing line between the two because the notion of life and non-life as distinct categories is just that—a notion, not a reality. Everything about living creatures that fascinated me as a boy are equally wondrous to me now, even with my new understanding of life. I think what truly unites the things we say are alive is not any property intrinsic to those things themselves; rather, it is our perception of them, our love of them and—frankly—our hubris and narcissism.

                    <br>
                    <p>The “simulation hypothesis” tells us that what we know as reality isn’t necessarily “real,” and we may likely be characters in one big MMORPG, actors in the grand alien auteur’s magnum opus. With continued advancements in quantum computing, the nearly decades-old idea seems only more and more viable. Elon Musk told Joe Rogan on his September podcast that we are now “most likely in a simulation,” while computer scientists and physicists continue to search for evidentiary bugs in the program running it.
                        This version of history makes us all stars in the movie of our life, avatars in our own unique predestined storyline. If we are naively existing in a video game, but are unable to tell the difference, how much does the truth matter? Our physical reality is increasingly digitized, and the next generation will likely spend most of their lives online.
                         </p>

                    <p>The morning I realised I probably don’t exist, I clicked on an article I first assumed was satire asking if I’m living in a computer simulation. After a quick read through, I was enthralled; the logic behind the argument was infallible. Yet I was hugely unsettled by the idea that our memories, emotions and personalities may be nothing more than freshly typed code.
                        <br>

                        The idea that our universe might be the product of a simulation is usually treated as a conspiracy theory, or a science fiction trope, but there are plenty of physicists, philosophers and other academic researchers who believe it’s a legitimate theory, and in practice may closely resemble a very sophisticated version of The Sims.</p>
